app.controller('CostCtrl', function($scope) {
	$scope.sum = {{ $scope.first + $scope.second + $scope.third }};

})

My question here is what equations or functions I would need to do a basic calculation of the three variables collected by ng-model. I just need to know what kind of code I would need to put here, and then what function, or equation, I would put in the ng-click in the html template to do the calcuation once the calculate button is clicked. 

I may be way off here, and forgive me if I am. I feel like I have the right idea, but I just need to have some of the elusive blanks filled in for me. 

I certainly don't want to have anyone do the entire code for me, but if you could help me wrap my head around the basics of how to do this, I think I can make it work in the different calculators I am trying to build. I hope I'm not making this harder than it needs to be (but I have a feeling I probably am). Thanks!

I just have one more quick question in the third tab.
