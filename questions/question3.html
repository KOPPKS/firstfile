//my last question deals with setting up a service to save my answers in each separate html template, or calculator, so that I can pull all of them together into a graph if needed.

I remember you stating that I would need to set up a service to do this the last time you taught last Saturday, but I was hoping you could elaborate on how I can do that. Again, I am hoping that you can just give me a solid push in the right direction.

Please feel free to answer me in slack or github - either way is fine with me.

Thanks again Daniel, I truly appreciate it.
